# Just thoughts


## Two main problems:

* Streaming data for inference signal
* Model to act on streaming data
  - Need historical data or streaming data to Streaming
  - Need rules or architecture or training env


## Ideas for signal


from some Quora post:
"It’s fairly simple, just follow these four typical indicators for a buy signal plus any news catalyst.

1) Follow the trend. This is no-brainer, see if the stock is moving up or it’s moving down.
2) Exponential moving average. Ensure the stock is trading above EMA 200 level.
3) CCI level. Commodity channel index is an important oscillator that can represent if the stock is either overbought or oversold. Ensure that the CCI value is above 100.
4) Average volume is at least 250 K.
5) Ensure there’s no other news catalyst influencing the prize movements.
If you are a typical day trader and if you are on a typical one minute chart I would suggest to observe at least the last five candles and see if the four indicators I suggested remains true. If you’re looking at five minute chart, thought I would see the consistent in the last three candles. An experienced developer can actually pull stocks automatically onto your scanner. When I am inside the chart, I am able to wrench in my custom study at the bottom of the chart within (similar to the volume bar). I use three bars. Green, when all the 4 indicators are positive, and Teal bar, at least one indicator is off, yellow bar, if two indicators are off and a red bar, if more than two indicators are off."
